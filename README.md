# Brain-Tumor-Classification-using-CNN
A deep learning project that classifies brain tumors from medical images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project includes a user-friendly GUI interface where users can upload medical images to identify the presence of a tumor. Built with TensorFlow, Keras, and Python for streamlined image analysis and prediction.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed. You'll need to install the following libraries:

pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python PyQt5 matplotlib  


Extract the dataset and place it in the project directory under data/.

Run the GUI Interface:
Run the following command to launch the GUI:
python gui.py  
Upload Image:
Use the interface to upload a brain MRI image and get the classification result.

File Structure
model.py: CNN model architecture.
gui.py: GUI interface script.
data/: Folder containing the dataset.
